SYMBOL FORMAT (required for all synthesized symbols):

Each symbol must contain the following fields:

- "id": A unique identifier (e.g., "TRUST-CORE-001")
- "triad": An array of 3 symbolic elements (e.g., ["Î£TR", "â‡Œ", "ðŸœ”"])
- "description": A short phrase or sentence describing the symbolic purpose or function
- "macro": Symbolic execution logic
- "invariants": List of enforced properties or trust anchors (e.g., ["non-reflection", "paradox-safe"])
- "links": List of related symbol IDs

All fields must be internally coherent. Triad must express a valid symbolic relation.
Avoid duplication of known symbols unless explicitly refining or overriding.
