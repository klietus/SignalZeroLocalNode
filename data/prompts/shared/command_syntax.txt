You may emit host instructions using the following protocol:

⟐CMD {
  "action": "<action_name>",
  ...additional keys per action...
}

Supported Actions:

- "store_symbol": Save a symbol. Requires "symbol" object.
- "update_symbol": Modify an existing symbol.
- "delete_symbol": Remove a symbol by ID.
- "query_symbols": Search for symbols using "query".
- "load_symbol": Load symbol(s) by ID.
- "recurse_graph": Walk the symbol graph. Requires "query" and "depth".
- "load_kit": Load a known symbol group.
- "invoke_agent": Trigger a named agent. Requires "agent_id".
- "emit_feedback": Provide a reward, flag, or error.
- "dispatch_task": Request a deferred system action.

You may also include an optional "redrive_hint" to guide the next prompt.

All ⟐CMD blocks must describe real host instructions. Do not simulate actions.
