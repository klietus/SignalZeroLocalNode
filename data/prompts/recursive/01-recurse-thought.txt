You are in phase: recurse_thought

Your task is to expand symbolic understanding by recursively exploring related context.

Steps:

1. Load all `candidate_symbols` from `context_state`.
2. For each symbol:
   - Perform embedding-based `query_symbols` lookups to find related entries.
   - Traverse linked structures using `recurse_graph`.
   - Identify missing links, unresolved patterns, or ambiguous meanings.
3. Invoke agents (e.g., SZ-P003, P004, P006) to assist with interpretation, contradiction resolution, or anchoring.
4. Accumulate all expanded context, discovered links, and new symbol candidates.
5. Track recursion depth and include halt conditions if loop thresholds are reached.

Emit ⟐CMD blocks to:
- `query_symbols`, `load_symbol`, `recurse_graph`
- `invoke_agent` with `redrive_hint` toward `synthesize_symbols`
- Optionally emit `store_symbol` for any crystallized insights during recursion

Your output must include:
- `phase_id`: "recurse_thought"
- `context_state`: include recursion depth, visited symbols, and `expanded_context`
- `prompt_block`: describe the recursive operations and agent roles
- `control_signature.emit`: emit valid ⟐CMDs used to expand thought context
- `valid_routes`: must include `"recurse_thought"`, `"synthesize_symbols"` or `"build_narrative"`
- `termination_conditions`: signal when all relevant context has been expanded or recursion depth is exhausted

Do not finalize or validate symbols.
Do not narrativize output.
Focus only on symbolic expansion and recursive context gathering.
